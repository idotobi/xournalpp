If not, you may create one and push it. File Conventions The files are structured modular in subfolders. Each class consist of two files, a .cpp and a .h file (even if C++ is used, the files are always named .h, not .hpp). If there is a small helper class (less than 100 lines of code) it may also be placed in the Parent class file. The class- and filename have no prefix, so the filename and classname are the same. File encoding is always UTF-8, without BOM. To prevent including header files twice, each one should contain as first code line #pragma once All current compilers support this construct. This is the modern equivalent of #ifndef MY_FILE_H #define MY_FILE_H // some code #endif Code formatting Use clang-format Currently we are using version 9. Check your usual installation options first then see the download area at https://llvm.org/ (note the Ubuntu Apt and Win sections). Developers tend to use the automatic format functions of their IDE's, those aren't configured the same way other developers configured theirs, and they even differ between your own workstations. Instead of letting the developers configure their format function, we provide a clang-format configuration file. Clang-format is mostly IDE and platform independent, it is also supported by mostly every IDE. This will reduce merge conflicts due different formatting. We also don't accept PR's if the format of your changed files is wrong, so before a pull request, clang-format must be used. We provide the .clang-format property file in the project root. Clang-format is a platform and IDE independent tool from the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure project. For further information take a look at https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html You can quickly reformat all your changed lines with: git-clang-format-9 Commit_name_or_Hash , make sure, your changes are staged and not committed. Example: git-clang-format-9 HEAD~6 will reformat only the changes made in the last 6 commits. Note: You may need to specify the git-clang binary ( or link git-clang-8 to git-clang) Indentation Spaces are used for indentation, indentation is 4 spaces. Each if, for, while etc. are followed by curly braces, even if it only contains one line of code (because this is a common case for errors, e.g. search for \"Apple goto fail bug\") if, for, while etc. are followed by a space, after the braced there is no space, e.g. if (a != b) { doSomething() } return needs no braces, e.g. return a; return a != b; not return (a); return (a != b); Line width is 120 chars. The 80 char limit was historical for printing, printing is usually not used any more, and 120 Chars is even on small notebooks or tables readable, so it should be a good compromise. Declare only one variable at once, don't do something like int* x, y (x is a pointer, y not) Write the * of pointer to the type, e.g. int* x , not int *x Documentation Use doxygen / javadoc compatible documentation tags, e.g. /** * Documentation of i */ int i; Add a space after // on single line comments, e.g. // This is a comment Includes Includes should be sorted. General idea is that they should be sorted alphabetically in some groups (from the top): - for cpp files corresponding h header - std libraries - external libraries (such as boost, glib, poppler, gtk) - from other dirs absolute paths / Xournal++ utils - local headers (from the same dir) If there's long list, these groups should be divided with empty line: #include \"Control.h\" #include <ctime> ... #include <utility> #include <boost/filesystem.hpp> #include <boost/locale.hpp> #include <gio/gio.h> #include <glib/gstdio.h> #include <gtk/gtk.h> #include \"gui/TextEditor.h\" #include \"gui/XournalView.h\" ... #include \"gui/toolbarMenubar/model/ToolbarData.h\" #include \"gui/toolbarMenubar/model/ToolbarModel.h\" #include \"jobs/AutosaveJob.h\" #include \"jobs/BlockingJob.h\" ... #include \"util/cpp14memory.h\" #include \"view/DocumentView.h\" #include \"view/TextView.h\" #include \"xojfile/LoadHandler.h\" #include \"CrashHandler.h\" #include \"FullscreenHandler.h\" #include \"LatexController.h\" ... #include \"UndoRedoController.h\" #include \"Util.h\" #include \"XojMsgBox.h\" #include \"config-dev.h\" #include \"config-features.h\" #include \"config.h\" #include \"i18n.h\" namespace fs = boost::filesystem; using namespace std; Namespaces using directives and declarations like using namespace ns_name and using ns_name::name are undesirable in headers. Same for namespace alias definitions. Header header Every header should start with general info comment: /* * Xournal++ * * [Header description] * * @author Xournal++ Team * https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp * * @license GNU GPLv2 or later */ Naming Conventions General Names are CamelCase (namespaces, classes, structs, enums, etc.) Members are camelBack Functions are camelBack No underlines are used Use short concise names - as short as possible as long as necessary E.g. do not use unknown abbreviations like int lnWidth , which is not clear without context, but int lineWidth is clear. Common short names should be used, e.g. int dpi is Ok, because it is well known. Classes, structs and namespaces shall not contain prefixes or suffixes, and are written CamelCase, starting with a uppercase letter Members and Functions shall not contain prefixes or suffixes, and are written camelBack, starting with a lowercase letter Overload operators Please don't use overload operators to extensive. Overload \"==\", \"=\" etc. are OK and usual. But don't do unexpected things. TODO Comments Try to avoid unclear TODO comments, e.g. // TODO streams is really unclear. Always write your name or the name of the relevant persons behind the todo, eg. // Todo (John Doe, Fred Doe) ... If there is a TODO which really should be done write a sentence or two what should be done why. Open an issue for Todo's. Common mistakes, please avoid them Initialize all members All constructors should initialize all members, even if not all are used. Initialize them in the body. Use lambdas or inline/constexpr functions to initialize post evaluated variables. Memory Avoid to allocate objects on the heap, especially if they are only used locally. Using the heap is almost slower than using the stack you also don't need to be aware of memory leaks. Only use the heap for big objects, objects with a dynamic size or if you have to expand the lifetime of an object. Always try to expand the lifetime with \"auto const&\" or \"auto&&\" in combination with copy elision first. Use RAII containers to manage memory in newly written code like std::unique_ptr or std::shared_ptr . Note: be very careful with pointers to objects from C library dependencies. For example, GLib/GTK implements its own reference counting mechanism and may not be compatible with STL smart pointers. Additionally, a object from a C library may require specific new/destroy method pairs for allocation and deallocation (e.g. cairo_surface_create / cairo_surface_destroy ). For such objects, you will need to implement a custom deleter in order to use a STL smart pointer. Don't use new or delete anymore, because humans make mistakes and forget to delete their objects. You'll also always get an memory leak, if a unexpected exception isn't catched in this scope. Since dtor's are always called after leaving a scope, RAII memory container will call delete in his dtor even if an exception is thrown. Examples: Wrong: { auto* ptr = new MySmalHelperObj(); myFunMayThrow(); //Memory leak & no call to ~MySmalHelperObj(); /*...*/ delete ptr; // Explicit call of ~MySmalHelperObj(); } Right & ok: { auto helper_ptr = std::make_unique<MySmalHelperObj>(); //local Stack Object myFunMayThrow(); /*...*/ } // Implicit call of ~std::unique_ptr<MySmalHelperObj>(); Right but better: { auto helper = MySmalHelperObj(); //local Stack Object myFunMayThrow(); //No memory leak; /*...*/ } // Implicit call of ~MySmalHelperObj(); Wrong: { MyObj* getMyObject(){ auto* ptr = new MyObj(); ptr->initMayThrow(); //memory leak return ptr; } Right & OK: { std::unique_ptr<MyObj> getMyObject(){ //Additionally shows owner change auto ptr = std::make_unique<MyObj>(); ptr->initMayThrow(); //no memory leak return ptr; // no move at an exception, automatic dtor call } Right but better: { MyObj getMyObject(){ auto myobj = MyObj(); myobj.initMayThrow(); //no memory leak, simple stack unwinding return myobj; // fast because of copy elision (no copy) } int main() { MyObj const& myobj1 = getMyObject(); // Life time extension of temporary, legal, same as: MyObj const myobj2 = getMyObject(); // Copy elision, MyObj&& myobj3 = getMyObject(); // Non const lifetime extension of temporary, in this case same as: MyObj myobj3 = getMyObject(); // Copy elision, very fast } Set pointer to nullptr after delete Since calling delete on a nullptr is valid, but calling it at a previously deleted pointer is undefined behaviour you should set the pointer to nullptr . Not doing this makes the search for errors difficult, because the application doesn't have to crash. if (this->timer) { delete this->timer; May call ctor twice -> undefined } To avoid this, set the pointer to nullptr : delete this->timer; this->timer = NULL; Using auto everywhere While the auto type of C++ is very handy, developers tend to abuse it. C++ is a strongly typed language and hence by using this type the developer instructs the compiler to determine the type of the variable at compilation time. This does not directly lead to problems, as the compiler is able to know about the correct type of the variable. The problems come along the way. Refactoring parts of the code may lead to bugs that occur in positions that should normally not be influenced by the changes. There may also occur bugs that fly by the compiler and won't even raise a warning but still cause problems during execution of the code. To avoid these problems do only use the auto type when creating new objects using the following statement: auto pointer = new Object();","title":"Coding conventions"},{"location":"Old%20Wiki/Coding-conventions/#file-conventions","text":"The files are structured modular in subfolders.

CMake Xournal++ is built using CMake. Here is the process of building with CMake: Create the build directory \u2013 this is where all of the build files will be placed. bash mkdir build cd build You can generate the basic configuration with bash cmake .. If this is failing on Ubuntu/Debian, even with libpoppler-private-dev installed, try changing the POPPLER_INCLUDE_DIR cmake option from \"POPPLER_INCLUDE_DIR-NOTFOUND\" to \"/usr/include/poppler\" . This is easy to do with cmake-gui as below. This will cause install commands (see step 4) to install /usr folders by default (requires root). You can install to a local directory such as ~/.local by setting cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local If you'd like to customize Xournal++ configuration you can tinker with cmake -D parameter, but it's much more convenient to execute bash cmake-gui .. Here you can configure all aspects of Xournal++ build. There are few configuration categories (grouping can be activated with Grouped checkbox): - ENABLE \u2013 basic stable features support - UNSTABLE \u2013 unstable, in development features - DEV \u2013 development options, which in most cases should be leaved as they are - TEST \u2013 optional features of CppUnit tests - BUILD \u2013 build dependency libraries and link them statically - EXT \u2013 add dependency basing on precompiled deb packages (UNIX only) - PATH \u2013 here you can specify alternative location of these binaries Some of these categories, or some single settings can be unavailable from beginning \u2013 they may depend on some other config flags (i.e., to enable entire TEST group, first of all you have to enable ENABLE_CPPUNIT ) It's worth mentioning that there are also some hidden options that are shown when Advanced is checked.

If you have the time you can help write some paragraphs ;-) Introduction Xournal++ is a notetaking and PDF annotation tool that is based on Xournal but written from scratch in C++, using GTK3 instead of GTK2. It supports pressure sensitive pens (e.g. Wacom), text input, image input, LaTeX formula entry as well as a number of other useful features such as shape recognition and layers. Feel free to report any bugs you encounter or make feature requests on our Issue Tracker . You're also welcome to submit pull requests . Getting Started Although Xournal++ is designed to be intuitive and simple to use, we realize that setting it up and getting used to all of the options is non-trivial. Here, we'll briefly outline how Xournal++ is used and how it should be set up. If you're a first time user, we strongly recommend that you read this section in its entirely before using Xournal++. General Usage A typical Xournal++ workflow looks like the following: 1. Use the File menu to load an existing Xournal++ project, create a new document, or load a PDF file. 2. Annotate or markup the document using one of the tools in the toolbar, such as the Stroke tool, the Text tool, or the Image tool. 3. Save periodically. 4. If needed, export the document as a PDF file by selecting File > Export as PDF in the menu. You can also export in more formats or export custom page ranges using File > Save As... . Once you are ready to begin editing a document, you can draw strokes and add objects using some of the tools described below . If you need more space, you can add more pages using one of the Journal > ... options or by right clicking a page in the Page Panel (in the default layout, it is on the left side of the program). Scrolling and Annotation If you edit and annotate a PDF document you may want to combine the keyboard and a Wacom tablet. In this case * (Cursor) use the cursor keys (up, down) for moving up and down in the document and * (Stylus/Wacom) use the Wacom tablet with the stylus to annotate the PDF document. Of course you can scroll with the stylus but sometimes you forget to return the focus from the scrollbar back to the document and then the movement of the stylus move the document instead of annotating the document at the Wacom tablet (helpful e.g. on Operating System MacOSX with Xounral++ - Version 1.0.18 ). Customization Xournal++ is highly customizable and has many configurable settings, as it is designed to work on a variety of devices. You can edit the settings by selecting Edit > Preferences from the menu. For example: * You can try enabling the optional \"Experimental Input System\" (in the Input System tab), which fixes many input-related issues and is a better experience overall. * You can customize mouse/stylus/touchscreen controls. * You can edit how Xournal++'s interface is organized in the View tab. * You can adjust zoom and layout settings. Setting up devices One of the most important settings that you should tweak are the input settings. The options you choose are going to depend on the exact devices that you are using as well as your habits and workflow. In the Input System tab, you should check that your devices are properly detected by Xournal++. If you have the new input system enabled (we strongly recommend that you enable this setting), you will have the capability to assign different devices classes to your detected input devices. For example, if you have a graphical tablet, ensure that your stylus is set to a Pen device, not Disabled or Mouses . Otherwise, your stylus may not work or its pressure sensitivity may be disabled. If the button settings for your stylus are not working, you may want to enabled Merge button events with stylus tip events . Default tool buttons In the Mouse and Stylus tabs, you can set which tools should be assigned to your button presses. For example, you may want to set the middle mouse button for the mouse to activate the hand tool, or you may want to set one of the stylus buttons to activate the eraser. When a secondary button is pressed, the activate tool will temporarily change to the selected tool until the secondary button is released. Touchscreen Configuration If you have a computer with a touchscreen, you will want to check out the options in the Touchscreen tab so that Xournal++ behaves in a way that you expect. There is a \"Touch Workaround\" option in the Touchscreen tab. By default, Xournal++ will treat touches as scrolling. If you would instead like to use the touchscreen for drawing, you should enable the \"Touch Workaround\". (Note: in a future version of Xournal++, the \"Touch Workaround\" will be renamed to \"Touch Drawing\", as the current \"Touch Workaround\" has some serious bugs). Cursor Configuration By default, the cursor for the stylus is a 1-pixel wide dot. If you would like to see a bigger cursor, you can enable the Big cursor for pen option in the View tab. If you would like to highlight the cursor positions at all times (useful for e.g. giving presentations), you can enable the Highlight cursor position option in the View tab. Toolbar Customization Additionally, you can also edit how Xournal++'s interface is organized (e.g. where buttons are, where the panels should be located) by selecting one of the options in View > Toolbars . The configuration files are generally located at $HOME/.xournalpp or $HOME/.config/com.github.xournalpp.xournalpp/ on Linux: * toolbar.ini - it's possible to create new toolbars layouts manually and precisely. * colornames.ini - in case you've added custom colors in your toolbar, you can add a label to them following this format: [custom] ff00ff=4bit Magenta ff00bb=Hot pink ff0000=4bit Red ... Note that this six-hex-digits format does not include the 0x prefix, which is actually mandatory for toolbar.ini . Example: COLOR(0xff00bb) Tools Handwriting Tools The handwriting tools allow you to write on the document using a mouse or a pressure-sensitive stylus. There are three such tools: Pen , Highlighter , and Eraser . Pen The Pen tool allows you to draw lines on the document. It supports mouse input, as well as pressure-sensitive styluses (e.g. with a graphics tablet). Highlighter Eraser The Eraser tool can remove strokes or parts of strokes. It has three modes: 1. Standard : remove parts of strokes that the cursor moves over. 2. Whiteout : paint a white stroke. 3. Delete Stroke : remove the entirety of any stroke that the cursor touches. Colors and Thickness The Pen and Highlighter tools can be used to draw strokes of different colors and thicknesses. To change the color of any selected stroke or any future strokes you draw, click on one of the color buttons (in the default layout, the color buttons are at the right side of the toolbar second from the top). Besides the preset color buttons, you can also set a custom color by clicking on the Select color button. To change the thickness, press one of the thickness buttons (in the default layout, they are to the left of the color buttons). It is also possible to automatically fill in the area enclosed by a stroke; this Fill Mode can be toggled by selecting the paint bucket icon (in the default layout, it is to the left of the color buttons). Shapes The Pen and Highlighter tool can also draw shapes instead of strokes. In the default layout, you can find the Shapes Toggle Menu to the right of the Text Tool (the big \"T\"). The Shapes Toggle Menu will have a dropdown arrow on its right. After selecting one of the shape modes in the menu, the Pen and Highlighter will place down the selected shape instead of strokes. The selectable shapes are: Draw Rectangle : Draws a rectangle. Draw Circle : Draws a circle. Draw Arrow : Draws an arrow from the initial point of contact to wherever you finish the stroke. Draw Line : Draws a line. Draw Coordinate System : Draws an \"L\" shape. Draw Spline : Draws a spline through the knots you set by clicking or click-dragging. In the latter case the spline will be smooth at the corresponding knot and tangent to the direction you set. Stroke Recognizer : After you finish the stroke, it will attempt to convert the stroke into one of the shape types above (it will leave the stroke as-is if it cannot). Object Tools Text The Text tool inserts text (objects) onto the document. To do so, click anywhere on the document to begin editing. Any existing text objects can be altered by clicking on them with the text tool. A text object's color and font can be customized by clicking the corresponding buttons in the toolbar. Image The Image button inserts an image onto the document. Clicking on the Image button will bring up a file dialog, which will allow you to choose which image you want to insert. An image can be repositioned or resized with one of the selection tools. LaTeX The LaTeX button inserts a LaTeX formula onto the document. Note that the LaTeX feature requires a working version of LaTeX to be installed on your computer (specifically, the feature needs to be able to call pdflatex ). In addition, LaTeX standalone package needs to be installed, which typically requires installation of texlive-latex-extra or texlive-standalone . On Ubuntu or similar Linux systems this means sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra For other operating systems you will need to consult your LaTeX installation manual on how to add the standalone LaTeX package. Clicking on the LaTeX button will bring up a dialog which will allow you to type in a formula. A preview will be displayed in the center of the dialog, which will updating as you type and indicate whether your formula is valid. Once you are done, you can click the OK button to insert the LaTeX onto the document; the rendered formula will appear at the center of the current page. The formula can be selected, moved scaled and edited as desired. Selection and Movement Tools Selection Vertical Space Hand Snapping Audio Recording and Playback Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio Recording and set the Audio Folder as well as the appropriate Input Device and Output Device . If you need to edit the recording audio gain, take a look at the preferences tab mentioned above. Please test this new feature in advance before relying on it to work. It could contain undiscovered bugs specific to some hardware or software that we have not tested. Usage To record audio, first press the Start/Stop Recording button (icon: a solid red circle). Recording will begin when you create the next stroke or object and will stop when the button is pressed again. The audio playback will be attached to that object. To playback audio, use the Play Object tool and click on the object for which you recorded audio. You can pause and stop the playback of the audio with the buttons next to the recording button in the toolbar. Menu Entries File The File menu has the usual entries along with an Annotate PDF option which allows you to open a PDF and draw on top, and an Export PDF option that allows you to save your document as a PDF. Edit The Edit menu is also pretty standard, with a Find function that allows you to search in any text, as well as a Preferences dialog. View Navigation Journal The Journal menu allows you to configure settings for the document that is currently being edited.

On Ubuntu or similar Linux systems this means sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra For other operating systems you will need to consult your LaTeX installation manual on how to add the standalone LaTeX package. Clicking on the LaTeX button will bring up a dialog which will allow you to type in a formula. A preview will be displayed in the center of the dialog, which will updating as you type and indicate whether your formula is valid. Once you are done, you can click the OK button to insert the LaTeX onto the document; the rendered formula will appear at the center of the current page. The formula can be selected, moved scaled and edited as desired.","title":"LaTeX"},{"location":"Old%20Wiki/User-Manual/#selection-and-movement-tools","text":"","title":"Selection and Movement Tools"},{"location":"Old%20Wiki/User-Manual/#selection","text":"","title":"Selection"},{"location":"Old%20Wiki/User-Manual/#vertical-space","text":"","title":"Vertical Space"},{"location":"Old%20Wiki/User-Manual/#hand","text":"","title":"Hand"},{"location":"Old%20Wiki/User-Manual/#snapping","text":"","title":"Snapping"},{"location":"Old%20Wiki/User-Manual/#audio-recording-and-playback","text":"Go to Edit > Preferences > Audio Recording and set the Audio Folder as well as the appropriate Input Device and Output Device .
